Project Name: RememberAll

This is an open sours code that I am giving to Seneca CDOT for free use (if it is useful).

This platform was build to help caregivers (who can be a doctor or a family member) to take care of people with dementia. Ones the caregiver is registered and loved in, they will able to view their patients, some information about them and will able to register more patients if they want to. Ones they view one of the patients lets say “Bob Smith”, we will able to see their family members with their names at the bottom. Caregiver can upload more pictures and write a small description under it. After when everything is set, patient can take a test to see if they still remember their family member names. At the end of the test, caregiver will abel to see the results of the patient (if they are getting better or worth). The first number of the graph will tell us the number of attempt and the second number will tell us how long it took them to find a right person for each picture. Also, the third part of the project is to allow other developers to use our API to develop other test that can help people with dementia.

Languages: PHP5, MySQL, JQuery, Bootstrap, chart.js, html5

This project have only important stuff working, however small stuff aren’t functioning.
